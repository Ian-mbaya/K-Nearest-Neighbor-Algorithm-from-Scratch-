**Project Goals:**
The project aims to predict missing values in bird checklists using a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) approach.
The focus is on predicting the number of bird species rather than clustering, making KNN a suitable choice.
The primary goal is to provide accurate predictions for checklist submissions.


**Learning:**
The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model implementation, and evaluation.
Techniques such as log transformation and scaling are applied for data normalization and outlier removal.
The team learns about KNN algorithm implementation, hyperparameter tuning, and model performance evaluation using different distance metrics.

**Technologies:**
Python libraries and packages including pandas, numpy, and scipy for data manipulation and analysis.
KNN algorithm implementation for predictive modeling.
Metrics such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and Cosine similarity are utilized for distance calculation.
Kaggle submissions leaderboard is used for evaluating model performance and selecting hyperparameters.
